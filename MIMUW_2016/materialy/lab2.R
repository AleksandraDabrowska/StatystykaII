# Lab 2 - Statistics 2

## Simulations

Generate two-dimensional vector of random variables with corelation rho.

Try Pearson test / Spearman test on this pair.

Calculate power for both tests as a function of sample size.

Then try to use non gaussian distribution (log-gaussian, cauchy) and compare power for both tests.


## Exploration

- Find if there is any relation forauta2012 dataset between Color and Brand

Which test, which method should be used?

- Find if there is any relation between Price and Milage

How to plot it? How to verify it?
