# Lab 2 - Statistics 2
 
## Simulations
 
Generate two-dimensional vector of random variables with correlation rho.
 
Try Pearson test / Spearman test on this pair.
 
Calculate power for both tests as a function of sample size.
 
Then try to use non gaussian distribution (log-gaussian, cauchy) and compare power for both tests.
 
 
## Exploration
 
- Find out if there is any relation forauta2012 dataset between Color and Brand.
 
Which test, which method should be used?
 
- Find out if there is any relation between Price and Mileage.
 
How to plot it? How to verify it?
