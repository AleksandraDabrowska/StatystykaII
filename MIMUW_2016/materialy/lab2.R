# Lab 2 - Statistics 2
 
## Simulations
 
1. Generate two independent samples from gaussian distribution (100 observations each)
check: rnorm

2. Compute Pearson correlation between these two vectors
check: cor

3. Replicate this setting 10000 times and collect correlations from different runs
check: replicate

4. Present distribution of cor coefficients
check: hist

5. Find critical regions fot this test
check: quantile

6. Generate two samples that are correlated, calculate cor coefficients

7. Calculate power for this setting: fraction of samples that fall in the critical region

8. Calculate power as a function of real correlation. How the power behaves? Is it along our expectations?

9. Calculate power as a function of sample size

10. Try non gaussian distributions (log-gaussian, cauchy)  

## Exploration
 
- Find out if there is any relation in auta2012 dataset between Color and Brand.
 
Which test, which method should be used?
 
- Find out if there is any relation between Price and Mileage.
 
How to plot it? How to verify it?
